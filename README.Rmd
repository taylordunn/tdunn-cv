# tdunn-cv

My CV, built using the `datadrivencv` package, and my resume, build using the `vitae` package.


## Notes

* `vitae` requires `tinytex`, and for an updated version (`tinytex::reinstall_tinytex()`).
* Had trouble installing `datadrivencv` due to the `icon` package being renamed;
see [this issue](https://github.com/nstrayer/datadrivencv/issues/57).
Installing [this PR](https://github.com/nstrayer/datadrivencv/pull/60) solved it:

```r
remotes::install_github("nstrayer/datadrivencv#60")
```

* Added a `resume_mode` option to `create_CV_object` in order to produce a shorter resume document.
See [this issue](https://github.com/nstrayer/datadrivencv/issues/30).
* The PDFs from `datadrivencv` are typically very large file size. To reduce that size, open in Adobe Acrobat, File -> Save As, and select "Reduce File Size."
